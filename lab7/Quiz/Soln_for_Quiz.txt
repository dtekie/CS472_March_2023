1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?

//solution for #1

The "jQuery function" refers to the global function jQuery() 
or the shorthand $(), which is used to create a new jQuery object. 
It can be used to select and manipulate HTML elements, create new elements, 
and perform various other operations.

The "jQuery object" refers to the object that is returned when 
the jQuery() function is called. It is an instance of the jQuery function, 
and it contains a set of methods that you can use to manipulate 
selected HTML elements or perform other operations.

2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and 
make their background color red.
Sample HTML:
<body>
<h1>abc</h1><br><div>
 <h1>div-1</h1>
 <h1>div-2</h1>
 </div>
 <h1>xyz</h1>
</body>

//solution for #2

$(document).ready(function(){
    $("div > h1").css("background-color", "red");
});

3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
<!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >

</script>
</head>
<body>
<p>Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
</body>
</html>

//solution for #3

$(document).ready(function(){
    $("p").append("YES!");
});
